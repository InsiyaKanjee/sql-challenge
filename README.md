# sql-challenge

Task: is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
Will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. 

Created an ERD diagram and conducted the following analysis:

    Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
    Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
    Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
    Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    Listed first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
    Listed all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    Listed all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    In descending order, listed the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

Additionally also:

    Imported the SQL database into Pandas and 
    Created a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
    Created a bar chart of average salary by title.
